      Pomodoro technique is one of the time management technique. This method developed by Francesco Cirillo in late 1980s. This technique uses a timer to break down work into intevals, commonly use 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the italian word from 'tomato', after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.
